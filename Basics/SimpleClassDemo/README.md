# C# Class and Field Demo

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of classes and fields in C#, as outlined in the provided description.

## Overview

The `Demo` project contains a simple C# class named `MyClass` that showcases various aspects of class and field declarations, including:

- **Public Fields:** Fields accessible from anywhere.
- **Private Fields:** Fields accessible only within the class itself (demonstrating the underscore naming convention).
- **Read-only Fields:** Fields whose values can only be set during declaration or within the class constructor.
- **Static Read-only Fields:** Fields that belong to the class itself (not individual instances) and whose values are set once.
- **Multiple Field Declarations:** Declaring multiple fields of the same type on a single line.
- **Constructors:** Special methods used to initialize objects of the class.
- **Methods for Accessing Private Fields:** Demonstrating controlled access to private members.

The `Demo` class in the `Program.cs` file contains the `Main` method, which creates an instance of `MyClass` and demonstrates how to interact with its various fields.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Class Definition:** The basic structure of a C# class.
- **Field Declaration:** Defining variables as members of a class.
- **Access Modifiers:** Understanding `public` and `private` access control.
- **`readonly` Modifier:** Ensuring a field's value can only be set during initialization or in the constructor.
- **`static readonly` Modifier:** Creating class-level constants.
- **Field Initialization:** Setting default values for fields.
- **Constructors:** Initializing object state when an instance is created.
- **Naming Conventions:** Illustrating the underscore prefix for private fields.

This simple demo provides a practical introduction to classes and fields in C#. For more advanced topics, please refer to the official C# documentation and further chapters.
