# Literals, Punctuators, and Operators in C#

This C# code demonstrates the use of literals, punctuators, and operators.

## Literals

Literals represent constant values that are directly embedded in the code.  C# supports various types of literals, including:

* **Integer Literals:** Represent whole numbers. Examples: `30`, `0x1E` (hexadecimal), `0b11110` (binary), `1234567890123L` (long).
* **Floating-Point Literals:** Represent numbers with decimal points. Examples: `99.99f` (float), `3.14159` (double), `1.23e6` (scientific notation).
* **Character Literals:** Represent single characters. Examples: `'J'`, `'\n'` (newline), `'\u0041'` (Unicode).
* **String Literals:** Represent sequences of characters. Examples: `"John Doe"`, `@"This is a multi-line string."` (verbatim string).
* **Boolean Literals:** Represent true or false values. Examples: `true`, `false`.

## Punctuators

Punctuators are symbols that have syntactic meaning in C#. They are used to structure the code and define its grammar. Examples include:

* **Parentheses `()`:** Used for grouping expressions, method calls, and parameter lists.
* **Braces `{}`:** Used for defining code blocks, such as the body of a method or a loop.
* **Brackets `[]`:** Used for arrays and indexers.
* **Semicolon `;`:** Used to terminate statements.
* **Comma `,`:** Used to separate variables, parameters, and elements in lists.
* **Dot `.`:** Used to access members (methods, properties) of objects.

## Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands (values or variables). C# provides a wide range of operators, including:

* **Arithmetic Operators:** Perform mathematical operations. Examples: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus).
* **Assignment Operators:** Assign values to variables. Examples: `=` (assignment), `+=` (addition assignment), `-=` (subtraction assignment), `*=`, `/=`.
* **Comparison Operators:** Compare values and return a boolean result. Examples: `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).
* **Logical Operators:** Perform logical operations on boolean values. Examples: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT).

This example code demonstrates the basic usage of these language elements.  Understanding literals, punctuators, and operators is fundamental to writing C# code.
