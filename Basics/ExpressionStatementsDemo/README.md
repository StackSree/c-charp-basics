## 📖 Overview

C# treats expressions as first-class citizens. This demo walks through how expression **statements** — expressions that perform an action — are used in different contexts, including:

- Variable assignment
- Method calls
- Object instantiation
- LINQ and lambdas
- Expression-bodied members
- Async/await
- Expression trees
