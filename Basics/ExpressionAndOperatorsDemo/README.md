## Requirements

- .NET SDK (latest version recommended)
- A C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or CLI `dotnet` commands)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or copy the code into a new C# Console Application.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
