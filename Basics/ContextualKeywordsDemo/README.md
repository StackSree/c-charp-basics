# C# Contextual Keywords Demo

This project demonstrates the use of contextual keywords in C#.

## What are Contextual Keywords?
Contextual keywords in C# have a special meaning in specific contexts but are not reserved words. This means they can be used as identifiers when not in their special meaning.

## Example Keywords Used in This Project:
- **async / await** - Used for asynchronous programming.
- **var** - Used for type inference.
- **dynamic** - Allows runtime type changes.
- **yield** - Used in iterators to return values lazily.
- **partial** - Defines a class that can be split into multiple files.
- **from, where, orderby, select** - Used in LINQ queries.
- **descending, ascending** - Specifies sorting order in LINQ.
- **get, set** - Used in property accessors.
- **group, join, into** - Used in LINQ for grouping and joining data.
- **nameof** - Returns the string name of a variable or type.
- **init** - Used for initialization-only properties.
- **global** - Specifies a namespace reference.
- **file** - Used to define a file-scoped type.

## Sample Output:

Number: 42

Linq Query Result: 3 2
