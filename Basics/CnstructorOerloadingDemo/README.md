# Constructor Overloading Demo in C#

This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates **constructor overloading** and how to chain constructors using the `this` keyword.

## üìå Key Concepts

- **Constructor Overloading**: Multiple constructors with different parameter lists allow creating objects in various ways.
- **Constructor Chaining**: One constructor can call another to avoid duplicating initialization logic.
- **No Optional Parameters in Overloads with Same Signature**: Optional parameters cannot be combined with overloads that could lead to ambiguous calls.

## üì¶ Class: Wine

```csharp
public class Wine
{
    public decimal Price;
    public int Year;

    // Constructor 1: Price only
    public Wine(decimal price)

    // Constructor 2: Price and year
    public Wine(decimal price, int year)

    // Constructor 3: Price and DateTime
    public Wine(decimal price, DateTime date)
}
```

### üîÑ Constructor Chaining

Each constructor uses the `this(...)` keyword to delegate to a simpler constructor:

```csharp
public Wine(decimal price, int year) : this(price) { ... }
public Wine(decimal price, DateTime date) : this(price, date.Year) { ... }
```

### ‚ùå Why Not Use Optional Parameters Here?

In C#, you **cannot define** two constructors like this:

```csharp
public Wine(decimal price, int year) { ... }
public Wine(decimal price, int year = 0) { ... } // ‚ùå CS0121: Ambiguous call
```

The compiler can't tell which constructor to use when you pass two arguments ‚Äî both match. So, in this example, we avoid optional parameters entirely and use clear, distinct overloads instead.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Output

```
Demo 1:
Constructor with price called
Wine - Price: 29.99, Year: 0

Demo 2:
Constructor with price called
Constructor with price and year called
Wine - Price: 49.99, Year: 2020

Demo 3:
Constructor with price called
Constructor with price and year called
Constructor with price and DateTime called
Wine - Price: 59.99, Year: 2015
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use constructor overloading with clear parameter differences.
- Use `this(...)` for reusing constructor logic.
- Avoid combining overloads with optional parameters when the signatures can become ambiguous.
