# C# Internal Class Demo with IoT-Based Example

This project demonstrates the use of the `internal` access modifier for classes in C# within the context of an IoT (Internet of Things) scenario. It features an `internal` `SensorProtocolHandler` class responsible for low-level sensor communication and a public `TemperatureSensor` class that utilizes it.

## Overview

The application simulates reading temperature data from multiple sensors managed by an `IoTDeviceController`. It highlights the significance of the `internal` keyword in C# for:

- **Encapsulation and Information Hiding:** Concealing low-level implementation details within an assembly.
- **Assembly-Level Abstraction:** Providing a higher-level interface while hiding the underlying complexities.
- **Preventing Unintended Dependencies:** Limiting the scope of certain classes to within their defined assembly.
- **Code Organization and Maintainability:** Structuring code logically and reducing the risk of breaking changes across assemblies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your system.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone or download the repository (if applicable).** If you have the code in a repository, clone it to your local machine. If you've copied the code directly into files, ensure you have the `.cs` files in a directory.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `InternalClassDemo.cs` file (and other `.cs` files if you separated them).

3.  **Build the application:** Run the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

    This command compiles the C# code.

4.  **Run the application:** After a successful build, execute the application using:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The application will simulate the initialization of temperature sensors, reading their temperatures, and sending a calibration command.

## Usage

When the application runs, you will see output similar to the following in your console:
Temperature Sensor 'TempSensor01' initialized at address '0xA1'.
Temperature Sensor 'TempSensor02' initialized at address '0xB5'.

--- Current Temperatures ---
[Protocol Handler] Sending read command to sensor at 0xA1 (Protocol v1.0)...
Sensor 'TempSensor01': 21.3°C
[Protocol Handler] Sending read command to sensor at 0xB5 (Protocol v1.0)...
Sensor 'TempSensor02': 28.7°C

--- Calibrating All Temperature Sensors with offset 0.5°C ---
[Protocol Handler] Sending command 'CALIBRATE:0.5' to sensor at 0xA1 (Protocol v1.0)...
Temperature Sensor 'TempSensor01' at '0xA1' calibration command sent with offset '0.5'.
[Protocol Handler] Sending command 'CALIBRATE:0.5' to sensor at 0xB5 (Protocol v1.0)...
Temperature Sensor 'TempSensor02' at '0xB5' calibration command sent with offset '0.5'.

Demo finished. Press any key to exit.

**Note:** The temperature values will vary slightly on each run due to the simulated random data generation.

## Code Structure

- **`SensorProtocolHandler.cs` (or within `InternalClassDemo.cs`):** An `internal` class responsible for handling the low-level communication protocol with a specific type of sensor. It includes methods for reading raw data and sending commands. **Note the `internal` keyword in the class declaration.**
- **`TemperatureSensor.cs` (or within `InternalClassDemo.cs`):** A public class representing a temperature sensor. It uses an instance of the `internal` `SensorProtocolHandler` to interact with the sensor hardware.
- **`IoTDeviceController.cs` (or within `InternalClassDemo.cs`):** A public class that manages a collection of `TemperatureSensor` objects, providing methods to read and calibrate them.
- **`InternalClassDemo.cs`:** Contains the `Main` method that demonstrates the interaction between the public and `internal` classes within the same assembly.

## Significance of the `internal` Class

The `internal` access modifier on the `SensorProtocolHandler` class ensures that it can only be accessed by other classes within the same compiled assembly (e.g., the `.exe` file of this application). This provides several benefits:

- **Hides Implementation Details:** The complexities of the sensor's communication protocol are hidden within the `SensorProtocolHandler`, preventing other parts of the system (especially those in different assemblies) from directly interacting with these low-level details.
- **Promotes Abstraction:** The `TemperatureSensor` class provides a higher-level, more user-friendly interface for interacting with the sensor, abstracting away the underlying communication mechanisms.
- **Reduces Coupling:** By making the protocol handler `internal`, you reduce the coupling between your assembly and other external assemblies. Changes to the internal communication logic are less likely to break code in other parts of a larger system.
- **Enhances Maintainability:** When the low-level communication needs to be updated, the changes are localized within the assembly containing the `internal` class, making maintenance and refactoring easier.

The commented-out code in the `InternalClassDemo.cs` file illustrates that attempting to directly create an instance of the `internal` `SensorProtocolHandler` from outside the current assembly would result in a compile-time error, enforcing the intended level of access control.
