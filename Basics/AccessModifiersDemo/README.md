# C# Access Modifiers Demo

This project demonstrates the use of the common access modifiers in C#: `public`, `internal`, `private`, and `protected`. It includes several classes that illustrate how these modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields and methods).

## Overview

The project contains the following classes:

- **`InternalClass`**: A class declared with the `internal` access modifier, meaning it is accessible only within this assembly. It showcases `internal`, `private`, and `protected internal` members.
- **`PublicClass`**: A `public` class, accessible from anywhere. It inherits from `InternalClass` and demonstrates the accessibility of different modifiers from within the class and its base class. It includes `public`, `protected`, and `private` members.
- **`AnotherPublicClass`**: Another `public` class in the same assembly, showing how it can access `public` and `internal` members of other classes within the same assembly.
- **`Demo`**: The main class with the `Main` method, which instantiates objects of the other classes and attempts to access their members to demonstrate the effects of the access modifiers.
- **`DerivedFromPublic`**: A `public` class that inherits from `PublicClass`, illustrating how `protected` and `protected internal` members are accessible in derived classes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or create a new C# Console Application project in your preferred IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).
2.  **Create the following C# files** (`InternalClass.cs`, `PublicClass.cs`, `AnotherPublicClass.cs`, `Demo.cs`, `DerivedFromPublic.cs`) and paste the corresponding code from the previous response into each file. Alternatively, you can put all the code into a single `Program.cs` file.

3.  **Build and run the project.** The console output will show which members are accessible from different contexts, illustrating the behavior of each access modifier.

## Demonstration

The `Demo.cs` file contains the `Main` method, which executes the following demonstrations:

- **Accessing members from within the same assembly**: Shows how `public`, `internal`, and `protected internal` members are accessible within the same project.
- **Accessing internal members**: Specifically demonstrates the accessibility of `internal` members within the assembly.
- **Accessing from another public class in the same assembly**: Illustrates that `public` and `internal` members are accessible between different classes within the same project.
- **Demonstrating protected access via inheritance**: Shows how `protected` and `protected internal` members of a base class are accessible in a derived class. It also highlights that `private` members of the base class are not directly accessible in the derived class.

## Key Concepts Illustrated

- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere without restrictions.
- **`internal`**: Accessible only within the same assembly (the compiled `.dll` or `.exe` file).
- **`private`**: Accessible only within the same class in which it is declared.
- **`protected`**: Accessible within the same class and in derived classes (even in different assemblies).
- **`protected internal`**: Accessible within the same assembly and in derived classes (even in other assemblies).

This project provides a practical understanding of how access modifiers in C# help in controlling the visibility and encapsulation of class members, which is crucial for building robust and maintainable software.
